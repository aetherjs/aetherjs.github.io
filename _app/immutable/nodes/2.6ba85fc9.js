Starting off with
    competitive programming in school left me with a foundation to build upon in
    low-level languages like C and C++.</p> <p>Uni projects taught me Java, Kotlin (I really prefer the latter) and Python
    well. More specifically, I have good experience with OOP development,
    various build/CI/CD systems, I understand JVM well and I can write good
    code. I have used python in diverse environments and use cases, for
    standalone apps and scripts, for making simple web APIs, and most
    importantly I worked quite a lot with python notebooks, for data analysis,
    mining and retrieval tasks. Frameworks like pandas, numpy, tensorflow, stuff
    like that.</p> <p>For some time, I been working on the basic skillset necessary for DeFi
    development: teaching myself Solidity &amp; EVM, along with JavaScript with all
    its blockchain dev toolset: hardhat, truffle, foundry, cast. As a result, I
    managed to work/cofound closely two DeFi projects. I am also really keen to
    capitalize on my understanding on architecture and low-level programming to
    add Rust to my skillset as soon as possible.</p> <p>I have plenty of experience in collaborative software development, and have
    a soft spot for nice products, clean solutions and analytics.
