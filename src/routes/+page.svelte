  Welcome, Stranger!

<p>My name is Vlad Repinskiy, I am a Fullstack developer in the making.</p>

<p>
  Even before university, I had experience with programming. Starting off with
  competitive programming in school left me with a foundation to build upon in
  low-level languages like C and C++.
</p>

<p>
  Uni projects taught me Java, Kotlin (I really prefer the latter) and Python
  well. More specifically, I have good experience with OOP development, various
  build/CI/CD systems, I understand JVM well and I can write good code. I have
  used python in diverse environments and use cases, for standalone apps and
  scripts, for making simple web APIs, and most importantly I worked quite a lot
  with python notebooks, for data analysis, mining and retrieval tasks.
  Frameworks like pandas, numpy, tensorflow, stuff like that.
</p>

<p>
  For some time, I been working on the basic skillset necessary for DeFi
  development: teaching myself Solidity & EVM, along with JavaScript with all
  its blockchain dev toolset: hardhat, truffle, foundry, cast. As a result, I
  managed to work/cofound closely two DeFi projects. I am also really keen to
  capitalize on my understanding on architecture and low-level programming to
  add Rust to my skillset as soon as possible.

<p>
  I have plenty of experience in collaborative software development, and have a
  soft spot for nice products, clean solutions and analytics. Let's work!
