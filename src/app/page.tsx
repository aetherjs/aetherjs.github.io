            My name is Vlad, I am a product-minded fullstack software engineer
            in the making.

          <p>
            Even before university, I had experience with programming. Starting
            off with competitive programming in school left me with a foundation
            to build upon in low-level languages like C and C++.
          </p>

          <p>
            Uni projects taught me Java, Kotlin (I really prefer the latter) and
            Python well. More specifically, I have good experience with OOP
            development, various build/CI/CD systems, I understand JVM well and
            I can write good code. I have used python in diverse environments
            and use cases, for standalone apps and scripts, for making simple
            web APIs, and most importantly I worked quite a lot with python
            notebooks, for data analysis, mining and retrieval tasks. Frameworks
            like pandas, numpy, tensorflow, stuff like that.
          </p>

          <p>
            For some time, I been working on the basic skillset necessary for
            DeFi development: teaching myself Solidity & EVM, along with
            JavaScript with all its blockchain dev toolset: hardhat, truffle,
            foundry, cast. As a result, I managed to work/cofound closely two
            DeFi projects. I am also really keen to capitalize on my
            understanding on architecture and low-level programming to add Rust
            to my skillset as soon as possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have plenty of experience in collaborative software development,
            and have a soft spot for nice products, clean solutions and
            analytics. Let&apos;s work!
